### DEEP FOCUS: Your Personal Productivity Companion


Hello! This project, titled "DEEP FOCUS," is an experimental application inspired by the Pomodoro Technique, designed to help individuals manage their time and enhance focus. It aims to provide a structured environment for those who struggle with distractions and a cluttered mind, ultimately fostering deeper concentration. I hope this tool proves helpful in your productivity journey.

#### Features
Pomodoro Timer: A customizable timer allowing you to set focus intervals of 25, 45, or 50 minutes, each followed by a 5-minute rest period.

Background Music: Integrates background music to help you stay in the zone during your focus sessions.

Timer Beep Sounds: Provides audible alerts to notify you when focus or rest periods begin and end.

Deep Focus Mode (4 Hours): A dedicated extended focus session for when you need a longer, uninterrupted period of concentration.

Interactive Checklist: A built-in checklist feature to help you organize your tasks and keep track of your progress.

#### Tools Used:
Expo Go (Snack): The primary development environment used for building and testing this application, providing a seamless way to create and share React Native projects.
